## 6DOF-Robot-Trajectory-Planning


Task:
1) Calculate and plot position, velocity, and acceleration trajectories of driving your robot model
from configuration q0 to configuration qf in joint space.
2) Synchronize your 6 joints to start and end motion at the same time.
3) Redefine synchronized trajectories for numerical control
4) Calculate propagated error in end-effector position.
5) Drive your robot model between 3 consequent points. (solve polynomial)
6) Perform trajectory junction.
